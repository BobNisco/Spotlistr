## v1.1.7

- Actually fix the post-load bug in Issue #28 from v1.1.3.

## v1.1.6

- Fix potential memory leak by unbinding events on empty context elements.

## v1.1.3

- Fix cases where waypoints are added post-load and should be triggered immediately.
  
## v1.1.2

- Fixed error thrown by waypoints with triggerOnce option that were triggered via resize refresh.

## v1.1.1

- Fixed bug in initialization where all offsets were being calculated as if set to 0 initially, causing unwarranted triggers during the subsequent refresh.
- Added `onlyOnScroll`, an option for individual waypoints that disables triggers due to an offset refresh that crosses the current scroll point. (All credit to [@knuton](https://github.com/knuton) on this one.)

## v1.1

- Moved the continuous option out of global settings and into the options
  object for individual waypoints.
- Added the context option, which allows for using waypoints within any
  scrollable element, not just the window.

## v1.0.2

- Moved scroll and resize handler bindings out of load.  Should play nicer with async loaders like Head JS and LABjs.
- Fixed a 1px off error when using certain % offsets.
- Added unit tests.

## v1.0.1

- Added $.waypoints('viewportHeight').
- Fixed iOS bug (using the new viewportHeight method).
